# ncrandom : Non-Cryptographic PRNG Kernel Module

This is my first original (i.e., non-tutorial derived) linux kernel 
module.  I suppose it could be useful for overwriting incriminating 
files before deletiong.  Really, though, its a practice project, not 
something for practical use (this type of rng making more since as 
part of a user application). Still, it is what I call quasi-useful in 
that it is not a practical solution to most related problems but 
could have hypothetical uses (i.e., not just "hello world").
