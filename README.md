# Learning Experiments in Linux System Programming 
## (Kernel Modules)

These are learning projects, not generally useful.  The first is simply a tutorial 
I followed.  The second original and quasi-useful, a non-cryptographic pseudorandom 
number generator, something that would make more since in application code.

I'd like to go further, move into more practical areas such as device drivers.  However 
I think I might need to get an actual book or two on the subject to bette study it 
first -- and an actual device to drive, one I understand and that lacks a driver, 
would also be helpful for that.
